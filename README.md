## Application task.
**The task involves developing an application that can calculate the BMI value of a family member.**

The application will be built on a family tree that has several members with unique IDs and a family ID. Each member will have the following details:

-Name
*Date of birth
+Profession
-Gender
*Whether they are deceased or not
+Parents' details (name, ID)
-Children's details (name, ID)
*Spouse's details (name, ID)
+Height
-Weight

To create an application for calculating BMI, it is necessary to write code that takes input for height and weight from the user. The code should then calculate the BMI using a formula that involves dividing weight (in kilograms) by the square of height (in meters). Finally, the calculated BMI should be displayed to the user as output.

One potential approach is to enable users to provide their name and age as input data. This information can be utilized to search for family members of comparable age and gender in the family tree. A list of these relatives and their corresponding BMI values can then be presented to the user, enabling them to compare their BMI with that of their family members.

The description of the system can be found in this [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t4Z-sP19EeR8qOHXwlOQbFduB3_aRuEj/view?usp=sharing).
